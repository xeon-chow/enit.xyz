My name is Yihui Xie. You can know more about me on the [homepage](/) and my
[vitae](../vitae/). This blog is about statistics, R, graphics, life, and fun,
with a special focus on R. I often update my old posts (even after years) to
correct errors and remove outdated information, so please don't take everything
for granted. All opinions expressed here are my own, and I don't represent
anyone else such as my employer.

## Contact me

You can find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/yihui) (where I'm active almost
every day) or Twitter [\@xieyihui](http://twitter.com/xieyihui) or Mastodon
[\@yihui\@mastodon.social](https://mastodon.social/@yihui) (I don't read social
media often, so please don't expect me to respond quickly or at all on social
media). You may subscribe to the RSS feed of [blog posts](../index.xml) or watch
the [comments repository](https://github.com/yihui/yihui.org/discussions) to
stay tuned. I don't like formality, so it is not necessary to call me "Dr Xie"
when you email or introduce me. I'm a software engineer, so please don't call me
professor.
